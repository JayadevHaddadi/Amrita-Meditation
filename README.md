# Amrita-Meditation
A app that can guide your meditation that might have many steps, on finish it will give the user a chance to rate the meditation and write something about it, this will be locally stored and can optionally be synced with google calendar.

I have personally used it for my Amrita Iam meditation techniquie. https://www.iam-meditation.org/
But since this meditation technique is not publicly displayed I have removed all meditation parts.

To make it work with google calender you need to create your google calendar key that you generate from your own computer. Google calendar api accepts only preregistered package certificates.
